## ⚠️ Important Note Regarding UI Theme

This application is built using **Ionic Framework**, which deeply integrates with your system's and browser's native color scheme preferences.

For the **best visual experience** (especially to enjoy the Glassmorphism effects and correct contrast):

- The app automatically detects your system preference on startup.
- If you switch modes manually using the toggle button ☀️/🌙, **it is recommended that your browser's theme matches the selected mode.**

> **Why?** Ionic components (like Modals and Alerts) inherit base styles from the browser's `prefers-color-scheme` media query. Keeping them in sync ensures 100% color consistency.

## 🛠️ Installation & Running

You don't need Node.js or Postgres installed. Just **Docker**!

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/moaazhf/Task-Management.git](https://github.com/moaazhf/Task-Management.git)
cd Task-Management
```

**Markdown**

### 2. Environment Variables (Optional)

The project comes with a default configuration in `docker-compose.yml`. However, if you want to customize the database credentials:

1. Rename the example file in the backend folder:
   **Bash**

   ```
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

2. Open `.env` and update the values:
   **Code snippet**

   ```
   DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   DB_DATABASE=task_management
   ```

### 3. Run with Docker 🐳

This command will pull the images and start the full stack:

**Bash**

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend:** Communicates via REST API.
- **Backend:** NestJS handles business logic and connects to Postgres via TypeORM.
- **Database:** Data persistency using Docker Volumes.
- **Containerization:** Multi-stage builds for optimized image size (approx. 57MB).
